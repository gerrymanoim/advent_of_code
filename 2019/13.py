"""
The arcade cabinet runs Intcode software like the game the Elves sent (your
puzzle input). It has a primitive screen capable of drawing square tiles on a
grid. The software draws tiles to the screen with output instructions: every
three output instructions specify the x position (distance from the left), y
position (distance from the top), and tile id. The tile id is interpreted as
follows:

- 0 is an empty tile. No game object appears in this tile.
- 1 is a wall tile. Walls are indestructible barriers.
- 2 is a block tile. Blocks can be broken by the ball.
- 3 is a horizontal paddle tile. The paddle is indestructible.
- 4 is a ball tile. The ball moves diagonally and bounces off objects.

For example, a ÃŸsequence of output values like 1,2,3,6,5,4 would draw a
horizontal paddle tile (1 tile from the left and 2 tiles from the top) and a
ball tile (6 tiles from the left and 5 tiles from the top).

The game didn't run because you didn't put in any quarters. Unfortunately, you
did not bring any quarters. Memory address 0 represents the number of quarters
that have been inserted; set it to 2 to play for free.

The arcade cabinet has a joystick that can move left and right. The software
reads the position of the joystick with input instructions:

- If the joystick is in the neutral position, provide 0.
- If the joystick is tilted to the left, provide -1.
- If the joystick is tilted to the right, provide 1.

The arcade cabinet also has a segment display capable of showing a single
number that represents the player's current score. When three output
instructions specify X=-1, Y=0, the third output instruction is not a tile; the
value instead specifies the new score to show in the segment display. For
example, a sequence of output values like -1,0,12345 would show 12345 as the
player's current score.

Beat the game by breaking all the blocks. What is your score after the last
block is broken?
